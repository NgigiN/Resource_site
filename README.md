# Resource_site
The DITA resource site is a software solution created to remove students' dependence on the admins' physical presence to access services or even request them. 

A user will log in and will be able to:
  1. Book a repair(software / hardware)
  2. Check on the progress of their repair
  3. Book a session being offered by DITA.

This project was created for the sole purpose of helping in service accessibility rather than an information site. I consider a module of https://dita.co.ke/ 

Samuel Ngigi Nyongo https://github.com/NgigiN created this project
